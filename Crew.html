        <h2>Lasse Skov</h2>
        <blockquote><p> "It takes a lot of effort to create something from scratch, and along the way you're sure to stumble into numerous obstacles. The only thing that turns concept into a finished product is steadfast and goal-oriented determination. That's what I've done for several years. Working on festivals, concert venues, in a studio environment or various other projects, I've always applied myself to find the right solution with an acceptance of nothing short but perfection. Ive been trained in Pro Tools, Complete Vocal Techniqye, Carmogn Technique and many other attributes that always come in handy."

        <h2>Kenneth Nielsen</h2>
        <blockquote><p> "When working with music there's one thing above getting things right: a good set of ears; and working with musicians for more than 9 years, have allowed me to practice just this. Now i want to share all of my knowledge with you. Before co-founding the studio I studied at Aalborg University and got a bachelor degree in medialogy, applying myself to the diverse opportunities of music, film and design. In many ways I focus on the multitude of aspects in bringing ideas to life. I'm familiar with using Steinberg Cubase and Avid Pro Tools, but my greatest passion is creativity, and I strive to think outside the box."</blockquote></p>
